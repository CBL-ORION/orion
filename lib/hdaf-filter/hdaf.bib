abstract="{Summary: The two-parameter family of Hermite Distributed
    Approximating Functionals (HDAFs) is shown to possess all properties that
    are essential requirements in filter design. When properly scaled, HDAFs
    provide an arbitrarily sharp high-frequency cut-off while retaining their
    smoothness. More precisely, bounds on the Fourier transform of the HDAF
    integral kernel show that it converges almost-uniformly to the ideal window,
    and that the pass and transition bands can be tuned independently to any
    width while preserving Gaussian decay in both time and frequency domains.
    The effective length of the HDAF filter in both domains is controlled by an
    estimate of the Heisenberg uncertainty product. In addition, a new
    asymptotic relationship between the HDAF and a windowed sinc function is
    obtained. In all calculations, we have aimed at precise error estimates that
    may assist numerical implementations.}",
